# rt-view

Dashboard view for [RescueTime](https://rescuetime.com/).

The goal of this project is merely to develop my skills in building
web-applications using [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) framework.

## Roadmap

- [ ] create a design for a project:
    - [ ] create view for user authorization;
    - [x] create view with user's statistics.
- [ ] implementing design into a web-app:
    - [ ] create static markup for login page;
    - [x] create static markup for statistics page;
    - [ ] fetch user data using RescueTime API and display it on page.
